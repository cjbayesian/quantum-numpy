## Simulating Quantum Circuits in Numpy 

The aim here is to gain a basic understanding of quantum computation by building up the mathematics in python and ultimately building a quantum circuit simulator using only numpy (so it won't be so mysterious to a Data Scientist like me!). This notebook is not meant to be a stand-alone introduction to quantum computing. It is rather the notes I took as I worked through a variety of excellent, and not-so excellent tutorials I found across the web.

In the excellent category, I would firmly place Andy Matuschak and Michael Nielsen's experimental essay [Quantum computing for the very curious](https://quantum.country/qcvc).
